## This repository contains a collection of C programs that I have completed during my class. Each program demonstrates various concepts and techniques learned throughout the course, covering topics such as:

Basic syntax and control structures
Functions and modular programming
Data structures (arrays, linked lists, etc.)
File handling
Memory management (dynamic memory allocation)
Algorithms and problem-solving exercises
These programs serve as a comprehensive portfolio showcasing my proficiency in C programming and my understanding of key concepts taught in the class. Whether you're a fellow student looking for examples, an educator seeking teaching resources, or a programmer interested in learning C, you'll find a variety of programs here to explore and learn from.

Feel free to browse through the repository, examine the source code, and provide feedback or suggestions for improvement. Contributions and collaborations are also welcome!
